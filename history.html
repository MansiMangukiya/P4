                      <h3>Pre-Mechanical Age: 3000 BC. - 1450 A.D.</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="texts">
                      <p> * Writing and Alphabets: During the 3000 B.C. the first humans only communicated through speaking
                      and or drawing pictures.The system, called "cuniform" used signs corresponding to spoken sounds,
                          instead of pictures, to express words.
                      </p><br>
                        <p> * Paper and Pens: for the Sumerians, input technology consisted of a penlike device called a
                            stylus that could scratch marks in wet clay. About 2600 B.C., the Egyptians discovered that
                            they could write on the papyrus plant, using hollow reeds or rushes to hold the first "ink"
                            - pulverized carbon or ash mixed with lamp oil and gelatin from boiled donkey skin. Other societies
                            wrote on bark, leaves, or leather. </p><br>
                        <p> * Later came books & Libraries: Religious leaders in Mesopotamia kept the earliest "books"
                            a collection of rectangular clay tablets, inscribed with cuneiform and packaged in labeled containers
                            â€” in their personal "libraries." The Egyptians kept scrolls - sheets of papyrus wrapped around a shaft of wood.
                            Around 600 B.C., the Greeks began to fold sheets of papyrus vertically into leaves and bind them together.
                            The dictionary and encyclopedia made their appearance about the same time.</p><br>
                        <p> * The first Numbering systems and calculators: The Egyptians struggled with a system that depicted
                            the numbers 1-9 as vertical lines, the number 10 as a U or circle, the number 100 as a coiled rope,
                            and the number 1,000 as a lotus blossom.Between 100 and 200 A.D. by Hindus in India who created a
                            nine-digit numbering system. Around 875 A.D., the concept of zero was developed. The existence of a
                            counting tool called the abacus, one of the very first information processors, permitted people to
                            "store" numbers temporarily and to perform calculations using beads strung on wires.
                            It continued to be an important tool throughout the Middle Ages.</p>

                          (with a voltaic battery) at the end of the 18th century made possible a whole new method of
                          communicating information.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p> * Morse Code:  The usefulness of the telegraph was further enhanced by the development of Morse Code
                        in 1835 by Samuel Morse, an American from Poughkeepsie, New York. Morse devised a system that broke down
                        information (in this case, the alphabet) into bits (dots and dashes) that could then be transformed into
                        electrical impulses and transmitted over a wire (just as today's digital technologies break down information
                            into zeros and ones). </p>
                        <br>
                        <p> * Telephone and Radio: Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876. This was followed
                            by the discovery that electrical waves travel through space and can produce an effect far from
                            the point at which they originated. These two events led to the invention of the radio by Marconi
                            in 1894.</p>

                      <p> * The First Information Explosion: Johann Gutenberg in Mainz, Germany, invented the movable metal-type
                          printing process in 1450 and sped up the process of composing pages from weeks to a few minutes.
                          The printing press made written information much more accessible to the general public by reducing
                          the time and cost that it took to reproduce written material. </p>

                            remarkably similar to modern-day computers. For instance, the Analytical Engine was to have a
                            part called the "store," which would hold the numbers that had been inputted and the quantities
                            that resulted after they had been manipulated. It was also to have a part called the "mill"
                            - an area in which the numbers were actually manipulated.</p>

                      <h3>Electronic Stage</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="texts">
                      <p> * In the early 1940s, scientists around the world began to realize that electronic vacuum tubes,
                          like the type used to create early radios, could be used to replace electromechanical parts.
                      </p>
                        <br>
                        <p> * The first ever discovery of the vacuum tubes, John Mauchly, a physicist, and J. Prosper Eckert,
                            an electrical engineer, at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania,
                            funded by the U.S. Army, developed the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) in 1946.
                        It was able to add, subtract, multiply and divide in milliseconds and calculate trajectory of an
                            artillery round in 20 seconds.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p> * The First Stored-Program Computer. A problem with the ENIAC was that the machine had no means
                            of storing program instructions in its memory - to change the instructions, the machine would
                            literally have to be rewired. Mauchly and Eckert began to design the EDVAC - the Electronic Discreet
                            Variable Computer -to address this problem. John von Neumann joined the team as a consultant and
                            produced an influential report in June 1945 synthesizing and expanding on Eckert and Mauchly's ideas,
                            which resulted in von Neumann being credited as the originator of the stored program concept.
                            Maurice Wilkes, a British scientist at Cambridge University, completed the EDSAC (Electronic
                            Delay Storage Automatic Calculator) two years before EDVAC was finished, thereby taking the
                            claim of the first stored-program computer.</p>
