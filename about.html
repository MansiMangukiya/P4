								<h3>What is IT?</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="texts">
								<p>Information technology (IT) is the use of any computers, storage, networking and other
									physical devices, infrastructure and processes to create, process, store, secure and
									exchange all forms of electronic data. Typically, IT is used in the context of business
									operations, as opposed to technology used for personal or entertainment purposes.
									The commercial use of IT encompasses both computer technology and telecommunications.
								</p> <br>
							<p>The term information technology has grown to embrace an array of technologies and related disciplines. IT still comprises basic computer-based information systems, including computing hardware, operating systems (OSes), application software and the data that is processed to produce useful information. Over time, each of these IT components and functions has become more complex, embracing ever-growing subsets of technologies and methodologies.

								For example, application development began as a relatively linear process where systems
								analysts and programmers created code to achieve a business purpose. It has evolved into
								a more cooperative and organic process that embodies application creation processes, such
								as DevOps and agile software development.</p>

								<h3>Importance of IT</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="texts">
								<p> As time goes on, businesses are becoming more technological based foundation.
								From Maintaining a standard level of service, security and connectivity to control those systems.
								Information Technology has sprung its wings and has allowed to make such a difficult task
									such an easy task within a spam of few seconds. In today's modern world the use of technology
								has boomed enormously and will only keep growing with more technological advancements.
									Information technology is important in our lives because it helps to deal with every
									day's dynamic things. Technology offers various tools to boost development and to exchange
									information. Both these things are the objective of IT to make tasks easier and to
									solve many problems.</p> <br>
								<p>Some of various tasks that an IT worker does is:
								<li>- Data overload: maintain huge chunks of data.</li>
							<li>- Mobile and Wireless Usage: taking care of business's remote access, allowing their employees
								to be able to work from home without any interruptions.</li>
							<li> - Cloud Computing: More and more businesses no longer have their own server farms,
							transferring their business data onto cloud sure does require worker with an IT degree.</li></p><br>
								<p>These are just a few examples of some of the works an IT person does. An average of an
								IT worker starts from $60K-$100K or more depending on the position of the person.
								IT has not only brought the world closer but also made it an interdependent system.
								It means we can share information quickly and effectively, without bothering about geographical distance.
								With the help of IT communication has become cheaper, faster and more efficient.
